If you'd like to run the migrations again, you can do so by running 'npx storybook automigrate'

The automigrations try to migrate common patterns in your project, but might not contain everything needed to migrate to the latest version of Storybook.

[22:16:18.567] [WARN] .storybook: 1 issue found
[22:16:18.567] [INFO] Attention: There seems to be a mismatch between your Storybook package versions. This can result in a broken Storybook installation.

The version of your storybook core packages should align with 9.1.1 (from the storybook package) or higher.

Based on your lockfile, these dependencies should be aligned:

@storybook/addon-onboarding: 9.0.15
@storybook/react-vite: 9.0.15
@storybook/builder-vite: 9.0.15
@storybook/csf-plugin: 9.0.15
@storybook/react: 9.0.15

You can run npx storybook@latest upgrade to upgrade all of your Storybook packages to the latest version.

Alternatively you can try manually changing the versions to match in your package.json. We also recommend regenerating your lockfile, or running the following command to possibly deduplicate your Storybook package versions: yarn dedupe
